Data and code from manuscript: 'Observing Others Give &amp; Take: A Computational Account of Onlookers’ Feelings and Actions', Joseph Marks, Philipp Czech & Tali Sharot (under review)

## Description of research materials

Debrief questionnaires are stored as PDF files.

## Description of data files

Data for each experiment are stored in Matlab files. 

Experiment 1: n = 32 
Experiment 2: n = 35
Differences in design between experiment 1 and experiment 2 are explained in the main text.

Column 8: Inequity (absolute difference between the percentages of the endowment that each person is left with post allocation)

Column 9: Feelings about own punishment decision

Column 10: Standardized feelings about own punishment decision (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 11: Amount of punishment (proportion of the allocator’s money that the participant deducted)

Column 12: Standardized amount of punishment (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 13: Allocator type (0 = Generous, 1 = Equal, 2 = Selfish)

Column 14: Frequency of punishment (0 = did not punish, 1 = did punish)

### PunishmentData1: Experiment 1, blocks 1 and 3

Column 8: Inequity (absolute difference between the percentages of the endowment that each person is left with post allocation)

Column 9: Allocator type (0 = Generous, 1 = Equal, 2 = Selfish)

Column 10: Frequency of punishment (0 = did not punish, 1 = did punish)
