# Marks2020_ObservingOthersGiveAndTake
Data and code from manuscript: 'Observing Others Give &amp; Take: A Computational Account of Onlookers’ Feelings and Actions', Joseph Marks, Philipp Czech & Tali Sharot (under review)

## Description of research materials

Research materials for each experiment are stored in Matlab files. The experiments were coded using Cogent 2000. Participants saw instructions before each experimental block. When they were ready to begin each block, connection to MTurk was simulated via a dynamic dial-up procedure. 

Debrief questionnaires are stored as PDF files.

## Description of data files

Data for each experiment are stored in Matlab files. 

Experiment 1: n = 32 
Experiment 2: n = 35
Differences in design between experiment 1 and experiment 2 are explained in the main text.

## Experiment 1

### FeelingsData1: Experiment 1, blocks 2 and 4

Column 1: Participant ID

Column 2: Block  
  
Column 3: Trial Number (excluding punishment blocks)

Column 4: Feelings about allocator's decision

Column 5: Standardized feelings about allocator's decision (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 6: Selfishness (percentage of money taken by the allocator)

Column 7: Endowment (amount of money endowed to Player B)

Column 8: Inequity (absolute difference between the percentages of the endowment that each person is left with post allocation)

Column 9: Feelings about own punishment decision

Column 10: Standardized feelings about own punishment decision (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 11: Amount of punishment (proportion of the allocator’s money that the participant deducted)

Column 12: Standardized amount of punishment (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 13: Allocator type (0 = Generous, 1 = Equal, 2 = Selfish)

Column 14: Frequency of punishment (0 = did not punish, 1 = did punish)

### PunishmentData1: Experiment 1, blocks 1 and 3

Column 1: Participant ID

Column 2: Block  
  
Column 3: Trial Number (excluding feelings blocks)

Column 4: Amount of punishment (proportion of the allocator’s money that the participant deducted)

Column 5: Standardized amount of punishment (z-scored for each participant separately)

Column 6: Selfishness (percentage of money taken by the allocator)

Column 7: Endowment (amount of money endowed to Player B)

Column 8: Inequity (absolute difference between the percentages of the endowment that each person is left with post allocation)

Column 9: Allocator type (0 = Generous, 1 = Equal, 2 = Selfish)

Column 10: Frequency of punishment (0 = did not punish, 1 = did punish)

### SuspiciousSubjects1

Logical variable used to exclude suspicious participants in the supplementary analysis (see Supplementary Materials and Supplementary_Analyses.m)

## Debrief Data

Data from the debrief questionnaires are stored as xlsx files. Each debrief datafile links to the questions listed in the debrief questionnaire (DebriefForm)
